# Introduction: Qolei® Wiki

### What is the QOLEI® Wiki?

The Qolei® wiki documents the core rules, structure, and processes of the Qolei ecocystem's economy and governance. It provides the foundation for all organizations in the Qolei ecosystem, by anchoring the economic principles required in concrete and documented “rules of the game”, which everyone involved can rely upon.

### How is the Qolei® Wiki intended to be used?
The documents in the QOLEI® Wiki are intended to be used by the Qolei OÜ, all it's subsidiaries, the premier partner organisations as well as the Citizens as guidelines. The Qolei® Wiki allows us to collaborate on future policies in support of the evolutionary ideology behind the ecosystem. References to these documents are captured in the legal bylaws, operating agreements or other contracts to constitute the legal foundation of the ecosystems organisations.

### What the Qolei® Wiki isn’t

The collection of documentts in the Wiki are also **not an instruction manual or a guidebook** for participating in the Qolei system. Like the rulebook for a nuanced sport, it can serve as a critical reference at times, but reading it will not teach you how to play the game. If you're looking for an introduction, check out Qolei's <a href="https://Qolei.org/" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="http://Qolei.org/become-a-citizen" target="_blank">Become a Citizen</a>.
