However, it\u2019s not the internet, an algorithm or a software platform that will change society. People are the only ones able to change it. We make use of technology as a lever to lower the barriers that make it harder to implement change but ultimately, we as a society will evolve in the same way we have been for thousands of years, by talking to each other, telling stories and working together towards a common goal.

Technology such as the blockchain works as an amplifier, it does not choose what is done with privacy and independence. Let us use it to spread the idea that we can build a society where we do not have to look up to someone for guidance but where we all share a moral compass as guide. In this project we will use blockchain and other technology as enabler, not as a goal.
